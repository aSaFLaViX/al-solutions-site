    <h1 class="section-title">Our Services</h1>
    <p class="section-description">From AI chatbots to advanced data orchestration, we provide modular solutions that meet you where you are and scale as you grow.</p>
    <div class="cards">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Knowledge Bots</h3>
        <p>Intelligent assistants trained on your manuals, policies and FAQs. Our bots use retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to read your docs and databases, providing grounded answers with citations and saving your team precious time.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Data Copilot API</h3>
        <p>Empower your non‑technical teams. The Copilot API turns natural language questions into SQL, ES|QL or BigQuery queries, runs them on live data and returns answers with clear business explanations and relevant documentation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Multi‑Agent Orchestration</h3>
        <p>We design systems of cooperating agents that decompose complex tasks into smaller steps: planning, retrieval, querying, synthesis and quality control. The result is a reliable workflow that consistently delivers the right answer.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Custom AI Pipelines</h3>
        <p>End‑to‑end pipeline development: ingest structured and unstructured data, create embeddings, build vector indexes and expose them via APIs or chatbots. Perfect for product manuals, research corpora, logs and more.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">How We Work</h2>
    <p class="section-description">We approach each project pragmatically: start with a scoped pilot that connects to your data and proves value quickly, then expand and harden the solution for production.</p>
    <div style="max-width:780px;margin:0 auto;">
      <h3>1. Discovery & Scoping</h3>
      <p>We listen to your challenges and identify the highest‑impact use cases. Together we prioritise the data sources and define what success looks like.</p>
      <h3>2. Pilot Implementation</h3>
      <p>In just a few weeks we build a working prototype in your cloud environment, connecting to your documents and databases and demonstrating real results.</p>
      <h3>3. Production & Expansion</h3>
      <p>Once the pilot proves its value, we scale the architecture, integrate with your systems and provide hand‑off so your team can operate and extend the solution.</p>
